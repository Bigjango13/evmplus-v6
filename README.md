## Requirements for building and running

In order to build and run the code for production, you will need Docker installed

## Server configuration

This program depends on the following to fully function:

1. A [MySQL server](#mysql-setup) (required)
2. An [sFTP server](#sftp-setup) (required)
3. [AWS SMTP credentials](#aws-setup) (required)
4. A [Discord bot token](#discord-bot-setup) (optional)

To help with setup, see [building the CLI utilities.](#building-the-cli-utilities)

### MySQL setup

The MySQL server has to be installed, have the [X Plugin enabled](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/x-plugin.html), a database created, and a user who can manage that database.

Once the user is created, fill in the appropriate configuration variables in `server/.env.default`, and copy the configured file to `util-cli/.env` and `server/.env`

Run `util-cli/dist/databseSetup.js`

### sFTP setup

The following instructions will be for a Linux server

1. On the Linux server, create the desired user to store information
2. Create a SSL public and private key pair with the following command:

    `ssh-keygen -b 2048 -f filestore_access_key`

3. Copy the contents of `filestore_access_key.pub` to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` in the user folder for the user created before
4. Ensure that the SSL key is accessible to the server process, and configure `server/.env` to point to the new SSL key

### AWS setup

1. [Acquire AWS credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/getting-your-credentials.html)
2. Manage the IAM user created to allow access to SMTP
3. Store the AWS credentials in `server/.env`

### Discord bot setup

1. [Create a bot and get its token](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html).
2. Store this token in the `server/.env`

## Building the CLI utilities

1. In the `util-cli` directory, run `npm install --no-package-lock`

## Building the server

In the repository directory, build the docker image:

`docker build --tag capunit-com .`

When you change the server configuration, you will have to run this command again

## Running the server

As it is a docker image, you can run the following:

`docker run -it --name=capunit-com -v /google-keys:/google-keys:ro -v /drive-ssl-key:/drive-ssl-key:ro -p 80:3001 capunit-com:1.0`

This command assumes that the required Google service account keys are in the `/google-keys` folder and that the SSL key used for the sFTP server is located in `/drive-ssl-key` and has the appropriate path specified in `server/.env`
